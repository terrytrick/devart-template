## Description
How do our brains create and retain memories?  The answer to this question is largely a mystery; although our knowledge of brain function is increasing exponentially, as yet, there is no fully valid model that explains learning and memory.  Much is known about the individual brain cells (neurons) that send out axons to form profuse synapses with other cells so that communication can occur.  But how does this system of synaptic connection create a neural network that continually adjusts to reflect the complexity of events taking place in the external world?  It is a problem of scale, of course.  We can simulate segments of brain activity between a few dozen neurons but not the sophisticated computations between thousands of neurons that enable us to generate, in our minds, a new thought , an idea or a memory.  Memories Are Made Of This (MAMOT) takes a stab at bridging this huge gap in our knowledge and understanding. 

## Link to Prototype
NOTE: If your project lives online you can add one or more links here. Make sure you have a stable version of your project running before linking it.

#####The sound track on this video is a recording of a recording.  I do not, as yet, have permission to use the song so it is included here only to substantiate the initial idea.  A final sound track will follow as the project develops

## Example Code
NOTE: Wrap your code blocks or any code citation by using ``` like the example below.
```
function test() {
  console.log("Printing a test");
}
```
