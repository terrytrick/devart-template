# My first post explains some of the terms used in my Project:

Neurons
In the developing human brain, nerve cells (neurons) are generated through subdivision.  It is estimated that the brain’s cerebral cortex (the largest part) contains 15 – 30 billion neurons each possessing and transmitting information through electrical and chemical signals.  Every neuron is connected to thousands of others through a complex but orderly array of neural networks.  Efforts to comprehend the scale of neural activity include SyNAPSE, a multi-billion dollar program in the USA, which aims to develop an electronic neuromorphic  machine technology that scales biological levels.  In 2013, stage 2 of the program produced a system capable of emulating the action potentials of one million neurons.

Axons
Once positioned, neurons connect with one another by means of long fibres (axons) which carry trains of signal pulses, or action potentials, to distant parts of the brain (or body) targeting specific recipient cells.  Thousands of genes create products that influence the way axons sprout and navigate through the brain, branching and extending as they go to form synaptic connections.  Massed together, axons take up the majority of available space in the brain.

Synapses
Synapses are the key functional element of the human brain; they are the points, all 100 trillion of them, at which communication occurs.  This system of synaptic connection is continually refined and remodelled according to the pattern of electrical activity taking place in the neural networks.  Individual synapses are pruned away in some areas and reinforced in others so as to create a more precisely ordered pattern of connections. It is this process of continual activity-dependent modification that enables our brains to create a mechanism for learning and memory.  Exactly how this works remains a mystery but it embraces both working memory, which lasts only a few seconds, and long-term memory, which can last forever and includes episodic memory, semantic memory, instrumental learning and motor learning.

Memory
As I’ve indicated above, memories can take many forms.  In explicit forms of long-term memory (ie. episodic and semantic memory) the brain is capable of intentional recollection of previous experiences and information.  We can be explicit throughout the working day by remembering appointments or recollecting an event of years ago.  By contrast, implicit memory involves unconscious recollection.  Remembering specific tuition on how to play a musical instrument is explicit, whilst an improved ability to play an instrument as a result of a lesson is an example of implicit memory.  Given these complexities, the task of finding out ‘how our brains create and retain memories’ remains an elusive enigma.
